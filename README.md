Hello, world! I'm Adrian, a 15 years old programmer, I also like music and literature.
Well, I can't say I'm a expert in any language but I can do something in C#, Visual Basic and work with Discord.JS.
Learning computing and IT at https://ifc.edu.br/, expect something cool as I learn.

## I'm...
- ...not focused in any big project.

## Plans
- I plan to learn C++, C, JS, Java and Pascal;
- I want to learn music production.

## My inspirations
- Andrew (Endermanch, YouTuber);
- Gabriel Pato (Ethical hacker).
