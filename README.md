Hello, world! I'm Adrian, a 15 years old programmer, I also like music and literature.
Well, I can't say I'm a expert in any language but I can do something in C#, Visual Basic and work with Discord.JS, you can expect some small projects in C++ as I recently started learning it.
By now everything I do here is a hobby, but I have plans for the future that includes programming professionally.

## I'm...
- ...currently learning **C++**
- ...not focused in any big project

## The future
- After learning C++ I plan to learn C, Java and Pascal
- I want to learn how to make music

## My inspirations
- Andrew of Endermanch
- Gabriel Pato (Ethical hacker)
